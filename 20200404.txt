### A 0:30 - 0:44

Becuase Coronavirus is the biggest crisis of my life time.And it is inconceivable that we wouldn’t take a look at how that effects everything is going around in the world and the context of it.

### B 0:47 - 1:15

Well we didn't change the order because I mean, you know, frankly we wanted to get this out as quickly as possible.The biggest implications I would argue for this year are on China front, globalization and US-China relations.

And also on the climate front. Where 2020 was gonna be so much about the climate.And now not at all. Right? And clearly the Coronavirus crisis has the big implication on both of those things.

### C 1:16 - 1:20

So you're saying that this is bigger than September Eleventh(911) and bigger than Finacial-Crisis?

### D 1:21 - 1:30

Absolutely.Because you know after the Nine-Eleven and Finacial-Crisis the global order stayed the same.The alliances stayed the same.

### E 1:31 - 1:44

But that will not be true this time around. So I mean we're really taliking about changing the global order.This is the first crisis we had you know "G-ZERO" world.That means the politics, the poilitical responses isn't there,right?

### F 1:45 - 2:00

So I think that's extremely important.And then also the scale of the stimulus what we are talking about clearly already in the United States we're looking at seven a half percent of GDP minimum, first three tranches.

### G 2:01 - 2:17

Two thousand eight(2008),two thousand nine(2009) total US response was five percent of GDP.For this is said and done, minimum we are talking about a necessity of ten percent of global GDP stimulas.That is unprecedent in my life time.

### H 2:18 - 2:25

Then you keep using the word "Geopolitical Recession". What is the difference between "Geopolitical Recession" and "Economic Recession"?

### I 2:26 - 2:44

"Economic Recession" they happend roughly every seven years,some are big and some are small. It's an economic boom, bust cycle.

So we kinda(kind of) know how to the describe it we know what kinda tools we wanna(want to) use to respond.Now "Geopolitics" has cycles as well.They are much longer cycles. 

### J 2:45 - 3:06

So whereas the global order comes together and falls apart.And we are now this "G-ZERO" world. It's "Geopolitical Recession".

It's the winding of the old global order but new global order has not cohered yet.And you don't really notice this is that much even though I've been talking about it because it's what I focus on.

### K 3:07 - 3:20

Because as long as there isn't a crisis,well you can kinda pretend that the institutions still work and the politics are still there, we don't have new...anything.But now that you're facing a crisis suddenly you realize,the politics don't work.
