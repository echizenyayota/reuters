Becuase Coronavirus is the biggest crisis of my life time.And it is inconceivable that we wouldn’t take a look at how that effects everything is going around in the world and the context of it.

Well we didn't change the order because I mean, you know, frankly we wanted to get this out as quickly as possible.The biggest implications I would argue for this year are on China front, globalization and US-China relations.

And also on the climate front. Where 2020 was gonna be so much about the climate.And now not at all. Right? And clearly the Coronavirus crisis has the big implication on both of those things.
