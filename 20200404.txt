### A 0:30 - 0:44

Becuase Coronavirus is the biggest crisis of my life time.And it is inconceivable that we wouldn’t take a look at how that effects everything is going around in the world and the context of it.

### B 0:47 - 1:15

Well we didn't change the order because I mean, you know, frankly we wanted to get this out as quickly as possible.The biggest implications I would argue for this year are on China front, globalization and US-China relations.

And also on the climate front. Where 2020 was gonna be so much about the climate.And now not at all. Right? And clearly the Coronavirus crisis has the big implication on both of those things.

### C 1:16 - 1:20

So you're saying that this is bigger than September Eleventh(911) and bigger than Finacial-Crisis?

### D 1:21 - 1:30

Absolutely.Because you know after the Nine-Eleven and Finacial-Crisis the global order stayed the same.The alliances stayed the same.

### E 1:31 - 1:44

But that will not be true this time around. So I mean we're really taliking about changing the global order.This is the first crisis we had you know "G-ZERO" world.That means the politics, the poilitical responses isn't there,right?

### F 1:45 - 2:00

So I think that's extremely important.And then also the scale of the stimulus what we are talking about clearly already in the United States we're looking at seven a half percent of GDP minimum, first three tranches.

### G 2:01 - 2:17

Two thousand eight(2008),two thousand nine(2009) total US response was five percent of GDP.For this is said and done, minimum we are talking about a necessity of ten percent of global GDP stimulas.That is unprecedent in my life time.

### H 2:18 - 2:25

And then you keep in the word "Geopolitical Recession". What is the difference between "Geopolitical Recession" and "Economic Recession"?

### I 2:26 - 2:44

"Economic Recession" is happend about seven years,some big and some small. It's the economic boom and burst cycle.

So we can know how to the describe and we can know a kind of tools we want to use to response.And "Geopolitical" has the cycles as well.They are much longer cycles. 

### J 2:45 - 3:06

That is as the global order comes together and falls apart.And we are now this "G-ZERO" world. It's "Geopolitical Recession".

It's the winding of the old global order but new global order has not caught up here 〇〇.And you don't really notice this is that 〇〇 I've been talking about because why I focused on.

### K 3:07 - 3:20

Because the wrong isn't the crisis well you can a kind of 〇〇 in the institutions and the world of politics where we don't have anything.But now you are facing the crisis suddenly you realize the politics don't work.
