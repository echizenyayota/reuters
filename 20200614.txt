The right to challenge authority and government is fundamental to who we are as Americans.We do not need anyone including the President to try to sow further divide, further distrust and misinformation.The threaten to invade Seatle to divide and insight violence in our city is not only unwelcome it would be illegal.

One of the things that this President will never understand is that listening to community is not a weakness it is a strength.

A real leader would see nation wide protests the grief in so many communities of color,particulary our black communities and the call to be an anti racist society is an oppotunity for America an oppotuinity to build a better nation.

I also want to be a clear as I stated previously it is unconstitutional and illegal to send military to Seatle.If you don't believe me you can take the word of a line of highly decorated generals who have said so and have rebuked him.I have spoken with governor Inslee and together will assure the people this won't be happening.
