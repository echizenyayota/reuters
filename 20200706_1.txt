### A 0:18 - 0:35

We used to work weeekend’s private bands every Friday,Saturday and Sunday. We would be at the parties today. And it’s changed. We had no choice to 〇〇 the systems.We realized that people are at home. So I say “you have to bring them music,right? you have to bring joy”

### B 0:48 - 1:00

The hope is to get back that we work. We hope this hasn’t effected restraunts we were working. And then it don’t close is so good. We hope that when all this goes back to normal. People start hiring musicians.
