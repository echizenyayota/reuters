### A 0:18 - 0:35

We used to work weeekend’s private events every Friday,Saturday and Sunday. We would be at the parties today. And it’s changed. We had no choice but to adopt the systems. We realized that people are at home. So I say “you have to bring them music,right? you have to bring them joy”

### B 0:48 - 1:00

The hope is to get back the way we were. We hope this hasn’t affected the restaurants where we were working. And that they don’t close for good. We hope that when all this goes back to normal. People start hiring musicians.
