People send me masks now.And some really beautiful masks.Some are personalized. This one says "govenor Cuomo",it was made for me.Some say New York tough,beuatiful colors.I've masks sent to me from sports team Buffalo Bills mask.I have a Giants, Jets, Mets, Yankees mask. This one sent to me says "e pluribus unum",which I love,"out of many,one".

â€»"Out of many, one" means that "Many were combined, to make one." (It is a translation of the Latin phrase e pluribus unum, which is the motto of the United States of America. Under the doctrine of dual sovereignty, the many continued to exist in parallel with the new federal government.)

But any mask even if it says nothing,it does say something.There's no words on it,but it makes a statement.

### C 0:46 - 1:07

When you wear a mask, you say "I respect you".That's what the mask says to everyone you walk pass.I respect you.I respect you.I respect your health.I respect your privacy.I respect your space.I respect you.

### D 1:08 - 1:17

I can do anything I want with myself this is America,but I respect you.And out of respect for you I wear this mask.

### E 1:18 - 1:32

And I respect the nurses and doctors. So I'm not going to infect anyone. Or allow anyone else to be infected unnecessarily so I don't cause more stress under nurses and doctors.  

### F 1:33 - 1:57

This mask says I respect the essential workers who get up every day, drive the bus, drive the train,or deliver the food,or keep the lights on so that I can stay home and I can stay safe. It says I respect others and I respect you.
