This woman in rural Zimbabwe has found a way to make life much easier during the lockdown by hiring out an electric motorbike. It’s a part of a project being piloted by start up the firm, mobility for Africa ,where they lease out solar powered bikes known as Hamba to groups of low income women.

It’s particularly helpful for health workers like Pamidzai Mutyunya.She found some pregnant women walked tweleve kilometeres to the nearest clinic to give birth because there was no transport,but the bike has changed all that.

This Hamba motorcycle has made it easier for me to ferry patients to and from the hospital.We now have a fewer cases of pregnat women giving birth at home due to lack of transport the clinic, as was case before.

Mobility for Africa said women pay around 15 dollors a month as a group to lease the Hamba. It has a range of a hundred kilometers and costs up to 1 dollor to change the motorcycle batteries, which are charged at solar power station.

Fazer Eimebooner works for Mobility for Africa.Women in the rural areas carry the burden of carrying firewood, going to fetch water to drink and carrying school kids to the school. So as mobility for Africa we saw that we need to lessen the burden in women so we needed to test with the women so that you can see if they can be able to do some protective work during the time by serving time and serving their income.

The bike means the rural women can now carry farm produce to distant markets bringing in some extra income during lockdown. Mobility for Africa is now in the 2nd phase of the pilot project for the Hamba before it can go commercial.
